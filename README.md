# Smoke Marker
This modification places the marker icon on the smoke puff on 3D world and minimap.

By pressing Alt-key, it displays the distance to the smoke.
If the player is an observer, you can also check the time elapsed since the smoke point is created.

The mod is officially checked and approved by WG, thus is safe to use.
